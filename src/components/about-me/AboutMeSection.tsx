                I'm almost 18 and if there's <b>one</b> thing I know is that I love finding creative solutions for problems.
                <br/>
                Also, I enjoy designing small and big applications, while working in the frontend and/or backend (see technologies).
                <br/>
                I'm from Brazil and Portuguese is my native language, but I'm also fluent in English (C1).
                <br/>
                I started programming in 2017 as a hobby, but began taking it seriously in the start of 2021.
                <br/>
                In this time I took various courses and made a lot of open-source projects in my GitHub account, exploring
                different technologies.
                <br/>
                I'll be studying Software Engineering in Uniju√≠ from 2023 to 2028.
