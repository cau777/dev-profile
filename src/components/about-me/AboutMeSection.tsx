                    I'm almost 18 and if there's <b>one</b> thing I know is that I love finding creative solutions for
                    problems.
                    <br/>
                    Also, I enjoy designing small and big applications, while working in the frontend and/or backend.
                    <br/>
                    I'm from Brazil and Portuguese is my native language, but I'm also fluent in English (C1).
                    <br/>
                    I started programming in 2017 as a hobby, but began learning seriously in the start of 2021.
                    <br/>
                    In this time, I took various courses and made a lot of open-source projects in my GitHub account,
                    exploring
                    different technologies.
                    <br/>
                    I'll be studying Software Engineering in Unijuí from 2023 to 2028.
